Sample Application
==================
Live site on Heroku: http://warm-spire-6352.herokuapp.com/
----------------------------------------------------------

A sample_app  Application trying out different Rails tech and gems to previous experiance.


Trying out: 
-----------

- erb  - not as nice as haml!!
- using partials in the layout. - you need to have a rough layout in mind. 
- Also making static pages not just dynamic ones.

- Heavier use of:  Rspec & Capybara  -   Might revert to BDD with Cucumber and TDD Rspec for the rest

- Using Sublime Text 3 = awesome!!!
- RubyTest addon not compatable with Subliem Text 3   :(

Autotesting with:
-----------------
- Guard - for auto testing. not sure if it is better or worse that autotest...
- Spork - Awesome  run Rspec test in 1/10 of the time! great find.


Other
-----
- SQLlitebroser  - for viewing databases

Front End
---------
- Bootstrap (Twitter) - nice framework for a modern front end

- Factory_girl_rails - a DSL specialised in for defining active record objects. for use in test!
