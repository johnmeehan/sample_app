A sample_app  Application trying out diffrent Rails tech to previous experiance.


Trying out: 
erb  - not as nice as haml!!
using partials in the layout. - you need to have a rough layout in mind or this could be time consuming. 
Also making static pages not just dynamic ones.

Heavier use of:  Rspec & Capybara

Using Sublime Text 3 = awesome!!!
- RubyTest addon not compatable with ST3   :(

Autotesting with:
Guard - for auto testing. not sure if it is better or worse that autotest...
Spork - Awesome  run Rspec test in 1/10 of the time! great find.

SQLlitebroser  - for viewing databases
Bootstrap (Twitter) - nice front end
